1.) Earliest enrollment date.

SELECT user_id, user_first_name, user_last_name, user_enrollment_date
FROM Users
ORDER BY user_enrollment_date
LIMIT 1;

2.) The hardest CMPS course.

SELECT course_id, course_name, course_pass_rate, course_average
FROM Courses
WHERE course_pass_rate IS NOT NULL AND course_id LIKE 'CMPS%'
ORDER BY course_pass_rate
LIMIT 1;

3.) The easiest CMPS course.

SELECT course_id, course_name, course_pass_rate, course_average
FROM Courses
WHERE course_pass_rate IS NOT NULL AND course_id LIKE 'CMPS%'
ORDER BY course_pass_rate DESC
LIMIT 1;

4.) Students grades for their CMPS courses

SELECT U.user_first_name, U.user_last_name, C.course_name, G.grade
FROM Users AS U
JOIN Grades AS G ON U.user_id = G.user_id
JOIN Courses AS C ON G.course_id = C.course_id
WHERE C.course_id LIKE 'CMPS%';

5.) Get the list of students enrolled in a specific semester and their grades.

SELECT u.user_first_name, u.user_last_name, g.course_id, g.grade
FROM Users u
JOIN Grades g ON u.user_id = g.user_id
JOIN Semester s ON g.semester_id = s.semester_id
WHERE s.semester_name = 'Fall 2021-1'
ORDER BY u.user_last_name, u.user_first_name;

6.) Find the courses with the highest and lowest pass rates:

SELECT course_id, course_name, course_pass_rate
FROM Courses
WHERE course_pass_rate = (SELECT MAX(course_pass_rate) FROM Courses)
UNION
SELECT course_id, course_name, course_pass_rate
FROM Courses
WHERE course_pass_rate = (SELECT MIN(course_pass_rate) FROM Courses WHERE course_pass_rate > 0);

7.) Get the courses with course descriptions and outlines.

SELECT course_id, course_name, course_description, course_outline
FROM Courses
WHERE course_description IS NOT NULL AND course_outline IS NOT NULL;
