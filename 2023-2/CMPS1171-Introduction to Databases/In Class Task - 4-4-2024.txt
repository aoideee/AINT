Those of you that have completed the 6 Next JS chapters run the following queries:

1.) Which customer does invoice 500 belong to?

    SELECT invoices.amount, customers.name
    FROM invoices
    JOIN customers ON invoices.customer_id = customers.id
    WHERE invoices.amount = 500;

2.) How many customers total have pending payments?

    SELECT invoices.status, customers.name
    FROM invoices
    JOIN customers ON invoices.customer_id = customers.id
    WHERE invoices.status = 'pending';

3.) What is the total amount of dollars that have been paid?

    SELECT SUM(amount) as Total_Paid
    FROM invoices
    WHERE status = 'paid';

4.) List the names and emails of all customers.

    SELECT name, email
    FROM customers;
