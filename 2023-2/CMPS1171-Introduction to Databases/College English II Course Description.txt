College English Two (ENGL 1025) builds on the expository and argumentative writing techniques introduced in College English I. It also examines ways in which literature, especially poetry and fiction, may be used in writing for personal reflection and literary analysis. Students will write at least two essays in these modes of writing. The course further emphasizes research and documentation procedures and the effective incorporation of source material into essays. It culminates with a 4-5 page argumentative or literary essay.
